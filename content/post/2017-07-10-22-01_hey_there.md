This project has been a lil old plan of mine for a long time. Although I tried something similar once only with less and not only horror movies I realized this will be THE URN. So the idea is this: I chose 60 movies you can find below and I'm going to watch them in 60 days - one movie a day. Since this in itself is not a very interesting thing to do, the objective is to write a review about each movie. Since I work full time, a movie a day AND a review is gonna be a tight one so it might even change into a podcast? Not sure. We'll see how it goes! Keep checking back for the deets - like starting date, order and all those.<!--more-->
