I'm fairly sure some people wonder why some movies made it in the list and some are left out - most of the classics for example! Well, pull up a chair and let me explain.

There were a few concepts when I gathered movies for this list:

* Haven't seen a movie
* Seen a movie so long ago I don't remember well
* I love the movie and need a reason to re-watch

I tried avoiding lengthy franchises like Friday 13th or A Nightmare on Elm Street because if I watch the first movie, then why didn't I pick <insert random number here> but if I choose one of the later movies, why didn't I choose the first one? There's no good solution, right? I also realized I have some movies I realized I haven't seen despite I thought I have. I also have some surprising misses, don't hate me.

If you're still not satisfied with the explanation, you can always chuck a tweet at [@barveyhirdman](https://twitter.com/barveyhirdman) or wait patiently for my "podcast"/"vlog" (not sure which at this point) in which I'm planning to talk about the list a bit. Or a lot. Oh boy if you actually pulled up a chair you must be a bit disappointed. Sorry.
