Whoa so I realized I'm going to Spain for a week in August. Now that's not a problem at all if you ask me, but I'm not sure how to do this. There are three options:

1. Wait until I get back from Spain  
+ Take a break during the trip  
+ Try to watch movies during the trip (chances are this is almost identical to #2)
